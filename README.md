# Guide

### Initialize a loan

To create a loan, head over to the Create page. After you are done filling out the form click on 'Submit Loan' to initialize a new loan.

### Manage loans

To manage your loans, head over to the Loans page. Click on a loan if you want to open the dashboard.

### Confirm a loan

Both parties need to confirm the loan. All assets and collateral need to be transferred to the LendFi contract from the lender and borrower.

### Paying back a loan

Once the loan is confirmed, the borrower has until the deadline to pay back the loan amount plus interest.

### Claiming collateral

If the borrower has failed to pay back the loan before the deadline, the lender can claim the Collateral NFT.

### Extending the deadline
As long as the loan is not executed, the lender can extend the deadline at any time. Executed = paid or claimed collateral
